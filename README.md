# HistoryMap
This is the project I did in college for Projects, uses the google maps api 

This is a project to help supplement history lessons by introducing history about the surrounding area to 
students. Uses a map and points and infowindows to do so. 

Npm install
npm run time 
App.js is the where all the components are made use of 
Map.js stores the actual map, will need to change the api key to get it up and running as they started to charge me and no... just no.
database will likely need to change server/server.js
